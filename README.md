# Tapster

tapster is going to be a automated cocktail robot.

## Whats in the repo

In the repo is currently the firmware for the arduino 
controlling the motors, a stub on a node.js webapp that 
will communicate with the arduino to control the recipies 
and to active the pouring.

## TODO

1. write code to link the node UI to the arduino via serial
2. create some wiring diagrams for connecting to arduino 
   to the motors
